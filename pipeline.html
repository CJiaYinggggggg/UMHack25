    <p>Our pipeline begins with macroeconomic and social sentiment data processing. We start by cleaning data like CPI, interest rates, then apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and create a macroeconomic index.</p>
    <p>Next, we process cryptocurrency-specific data from platforms like CryptoQuant. We clean the data, engineer key features like RSI and MACD, and use XGBoost for feature selection to keep only the most relevant indicators.</p>
    <p>Next is data integration, where we merge and clean all data sources to build a unified dataset.</p>
    <p>We then move to market regime detection, where a Hidden Markov Model helps us identify current market regimes. Based on the regime, we apply tailored models like XGBoost, LSTM, or mean reversion strategies.</p>
    <p>Finally, the models generate trade signals, feed them into our backtesting engine, and evaluate performance using metrics like Sharpe ratio, win rate, and drawdown.</p>
